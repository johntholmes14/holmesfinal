Use the dropdown widget to explore different variables.\nFinally, the scatter plot shows the relationship between each variable and the total number of ADU units, plotted with a linear regression line. Use the dropdown widget to explore different variables.\n\n\nWARNING:param.main: column option not found for polygons plot with bokeh; similar options include: []\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\nUltimately, no clear geospatial trends emerge between the Census variables and ADU development. However, the scatterplots show us that there is a slight positive relationship between median rent and median income and ADU development, indicating that ADUs are more likely to be built in wealthier, more expensive neighborhoods. Conversely, there is a slight negative relationship between the total number of vehicles available in a Census tract and the total number of ADUs. This indicates that ADUs are more likely to be built in neighborhoods that are less car dependent.\nGiven that none of the included Census variables showed a strong, compelling relationship with ADU development, the next step in this work would be to widen the number of variables included and use those variables to conduct multivariate regression or machine learning to better understand and predict ADU development."
